MissingOutputException in rule AssemblyConfig in file /home/sjannalda/bgbm/projects/PlastidPipeline/workflow/rules/Assembly.smk, line 1:
Job 13  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
database/SeedDatabase/embplant_pt.fasta
database/SeedDatabase/embplant_mt.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
