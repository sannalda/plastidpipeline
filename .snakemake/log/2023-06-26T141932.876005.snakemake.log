Warning: the following output files of rule AssemblyConfig were not present when the DAG was created:
{'database/SeedDatabase/embplant_mt.fasta'}
Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule AssemblyConfig  in line 42 of /home/sjannalda/bgbm/projects/PlastidPipeline/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
database/SeedDatabase/embplant_mt.fasta completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 3
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
