Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule Assembly  in line 59 of /home/sjannalda/bgbm/projects/PlastidPipeline/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
assembly/embplant_pt.K105.complete.graph1.1.path_sequence.fasta completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
