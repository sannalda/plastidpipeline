##### Parameters for each section of the pipeline

### Fastp Options
Trimming:
    adapter_trimming_file: "../config/TruSeq3-PE-2.fa" # Path to adapter file, but you can provide your own file.
    Fastp_AdditionalParameters: ""
    time: "02:00:00"
    mem_mb: 1000

### Assembly Options 
# Parameters for GetOrganelle 
Assembly:
    organelle_database_folder: "database" # Can either provide a path if already made, or it will be created within the workdir
    OrganelleDatabasesDownload: "embplant_pt,embplant_mt" # Apparently GetOrganelle needs both of these first before proceeding
    OrganelleDatabasesAssembly: "embplant_pt"
    KmerSpades: "21,45,65,85,105" #  -k. SPAdes kmer settings
    MaxRounds: 30 # -R. Max number of extended rounds. Default is 15 by GetOrganelle
    PreGrouped: 1000000 # -P. The maximum number (integer) of high-covered reads to be pre-grouped before extending process. pre_grouping is suggested when the whole genome coverage is shallow but the organ genome coverage is deep
    GetOrganelle_AdditionalParameters: "-w 85" #-w 65 i.e. (wordsize)
    time: "04:00:00"
    mem_mb: 10000

    AnnotateIR: True # Refers to annotate plastid Inverted Repeat (IR)
    AnnotateRPS12: True # Refers to annotate plastid trans-spliced rps12
    AnnotationChloe: True # Refers to support annotation by ChloÃ«
    ChloeAnnotateCDS: True # Refers to annotate CDS from Chloe, is support annotation by Chloe is selected
    ChloeAnnotateTRNA: True # Refers to annotation tRNA from Chloe, if support annotation by Chloe is selected
    ChloeAnnotateRRNA: False # Refers to annotation rRNA from Chloe, if support annotation by Chloe is selected
    AnnotationMFannot: False # Refers to support annotation by MFannot. NOTE: Currently not supported
    AnnotationRevision: "Best" # Options: Best, All. Refers to only keep best annotation, or keep all annotations
    MPIMP_RefSet: True # Refers to use MPI's reference set of chloroplast land plants (CDS + rRNA)
    MultiGenBank: True # Refers to generate multi-GenBank

Standardization: # Standardization
    lsc_gene: "rbcL" # Gene located in LSC. Default is "rbcL" (previously used "psbA" with direction -1)
