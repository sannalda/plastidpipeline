##### Parameters for each section of the pipeline

### Filtering Options
MinQualityScore: 30

### Assembly Options 
organelle_database_folder: "database" # Can either provide a path if already made, or it will be created within the workdir
OrganelleDatabasesDownload: "embplant_pt,embplant_mt" # Apparently GetOrganelle needs both of these first before proceeding
OrganelleDatabasesAssembly: "embplant_pt"

# Parameters for GetOrganelle 
KmerSpades: "21,45,65,85,105" #  -k. SPAdes kmer settings
MaxRounds: 30 # -R. Max number of extended rounds. Default is 15 by GetOrganelle
PreGrouped: 1000000 # -P. The maximum number (integer) of high-covered reads to be pre-grouped before extending process. pre_grouping is suggested when the whole genome coverage is shallow but the organ genome coverage is deep

### Annotation Options for GeSeq
GenomeShape: "Linear" # Options: Linear, Circular
SequenceSource: "Land" # Options: Land, Algae, Mito. Refers to Plastid (Land plants), Plastid (algae), or Mitochondria
AnnotateIR: True # Refers to annotate plastid Inverted Repeat (IR)
AnnotateRPS12: True # Refers to annotate plastid trans-spliced rps12
AnnotationChloe: True # Refers to support annotation by ChloÃ«
ChloeAnnotateCDS: True # Refers to annotate CDS from Chloe, is support annotation by Chloe is selected
ChloeAnnotateTRNA: True # Refers to annotation tRNA from Chloe, if support annotation by Chloe is selected
ChloeAnnotateRRNA: False # Refers to annotation rRNA from Chloe, if support annotation by Chloe is selected
AnnotationMFannot: False # Refers to support annotation by MFannot. NOTE: Currently not supported
AnnotationRevision: "Best" # Options: Best, All. Refers to only keep best annotation, or keep all annotations
MPIMP_RefSet: True # Refers to use MPI's reference set of chloroplast land plants (CDS + rRNA)
MultiGenBank: True # Refers to generate multi-GenBank

### Standardization Options
lsc_gene: "rbcL" # Gene located in LSC. Default is "rbcL" (previously used "psbA" with direction -1)
lsc_gene_dir: 1 # Gene direction of lsc. 1 is forward, -1 is reverse
ssc_gene: "ndhF" # Gene located in SSC
ssc_gene_dir: 1 # Gene direction of ssc. 1 is forward, -1 is reverse

### Backmapping Visualization OPtions
MinReadCoverageWarning: 30 # Minimum number of reads for read coverage warning
